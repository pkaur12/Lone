Task 3: 
API Tests fall into the second layer of the traditional Test Pyramid.
The test Pyramid is a tool to inform how we design our automated testing suite. It is an ideal way to structure tests and guides us in achieving a proper balance of automated tests on different layers.
The pyramid is important as it guides us with a model of what a healthy, fast, and maintainable test suite looks like. It encourages a team to be wise about a strategy of what to automate at each level. 
The test at the base of the pyramid will be the fastest running test. As we move up the pyramid, the test becomes slower. Similarly, the tests at the base are the most isolated in what they test, and moving up the pyramid, the tests become more involved and more integrated with different services. 

Task 4:
The goal of an automated test suite should be to have a well-tested application and a suite that provides timely feedback. 
Scenarios that are good candidates for automation are those that test the highest impact features, are tedious to do manually, and provide the same result every time.
